      <h2>Why This Project is Different</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Purchasing a home from a traditional contractor (kablan) comes with
          the convenience of a turnkey solutionâ€”paying for a completed apartment
          and receiving keys on a set date (though delays are frequent).
        </p>
        <h3>Current Limitations in Shaarei Chesed:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            No new, single-level apartments available in the 200 sqm (2,100 sq.
            ft.) or more range
          </li>
          <li>
            Construction quality is often basic, requiring extensive
            customization after purchase
          </li>
          <li>
            Tax costs are high, as they apply to the full value of a completed
            apartment
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
