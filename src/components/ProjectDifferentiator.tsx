          <p>
            Purchasing a home from a traditional contractor (kablan) comes with
            the convenience of a turnkey solution—paying for a completed
            apartment and receiving keys on a set date (though delays are
            frequent).

          <h4>Limitations in Shaarei Chesed:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              No new, single-level apartments available in the 200 sqm (2,100
              sq. ft.) or more range
            </li>
            <li>
              Construction quality is often basic, requiring extensive
              customization after purchase
            </li>
            <li>
              Tax costs are high, as they apply to the full value of a completed
              apartment
            </li>
          </ul>
