        I'm an attorney with over 20 years of experience specializing in
        residential real estate. In addition to my legal background, I've been
        involved in real estate development projects across Jerusalem, Beit
        Shemesh, and Tel Aviv.
      </p>
      <p className="text-green-700">
        My projects follow a unique and consistent model—similar to the one I
        sold in Zichron Moshe—where a small group of buyers joins early in the
        process. Together, we develop a boutique residential building, typically
        with just 2–4 units. This approach ensures a close-knit community and a
        high level of personalization for each apartment.
