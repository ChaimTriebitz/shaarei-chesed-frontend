        <p>
          I&apos;m an attorney with over 20 years of experience specializing in
          residential real estate. In addition to my legal background, I&apos;ve
          been involved in real estate development projects across Jerusalem,
          Beit Shemesh, and Tel Aviv.
        </p>
        <p>
          My projects follow a unique and consistent model—similar to the one I
          sold in Zichron Moshe—where a small group of buyers joins early in the
          process. Together, we develop a boutique residential building,
          typically with just 2–4 units. This approach ensures a close-knit
          community and a high level of personalization for each apartment.
